    <p>This is a <strong>fan club website</strong> for The Collin College Guitar Studies, and is <strong>not an official website of the college</strong>.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzHr9xGhGSw&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank"> A tutorial video</a>
        has been linked into the site, to walk the end user though the user interface. First thing to note:
        generally whenever there is blue text, it is clickable. That's true with the navigation bar in the header, and the text in the footer.
    </p>
    <p>The website has three basic styles of interfaces: media, tables and tables with modals.</p>
    <p>
        The media style is used on the landing page, a.k.a. the news page -- and the faculty webpage that includes bios of instructors teaching guitar,
        among other subjects at the college. This same media style is used on the textbooks page. Meanwhile, tables are used for the rest of the site.
        But the performances and class schedule pages use modal technology, which pops up an overlay for additional information.
    </p>
    <p>The media pages have images that are clickable to uncover details of an event, news item or textbook.
        Clicking will run an animation, so that all other content on that page disappears, but for the news item selected by clicking.
        To exit the animation, simply click again on the picture, and the screen will return to its normal state.
    </p>
    <p>The modal pages have rows that are clickable to uncover details of (e.g.) a course schedule or a video playlist on You Tube
        associated with the school year or semester selected by clicking the row. An overlay will appear over the page with details of
        the row selected by the mouse click. To exit the modal, simply click on the close button, and the screen will return to its normal state.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, the footer has contact links for students and a section showcasing sponsor websites for student events.
        The rest of the footer is text and icon based, colored blue so they are clickable.
