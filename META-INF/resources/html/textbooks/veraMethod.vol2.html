    <p><span>This book is a continuation of the skills learned in Vol. 1. Some of the new concepts are reading music in upper positions,
        more complex rhythmic examples, playing two-voice music, and new techniques such as left hand slurs, scales, and arpeggios.
        The book also includes several solo pieces, ensemble works, and sight-reading examples in various positions. </span></p>
    <p><span>This textbook currently is only available through the college's bookstore.</span></p>
