    <p><span>This guitar method addresses all the essential topics for the beginning student: music
notation, chord playing, technique development, and basic music theory. Each exercise is
designed to introduce new melody notes and chords that accompany the melody. This
book works well as a self-study guide, in private lessons, or as a method book for a group
class. Special emphasis is placed on detailed explanation of fingerstyle right hand
technique. Such important concepts as rest stroke and free stroke, block chords, arpeggios,
and scales are all addressed at length with many useful exercises. </span></p>
    <p><span>All exercises are original compositions or arrangements by the authors. The book includes an appendix, which provides scales and additional solo and ensemble pieces. Although the material is
presented in a particular order, we recommend that you experiment with the order and
add elements that best suit your class. The pieces and exercises can be considered
departure points for the arranging process. Feel free to create accompaniments that fit the
style of the exercises or pieces and add dynamics, colors, expressive markings, repeats, and articulations.</span></p>
    <p><span>Enjoy the book!</span></p>
    <p><span>This textbook currently is only available through the college's bookstore.</span></p>
