   ☐ review news items content for corrections, e.g. "Dr" Mitch
   ☐ get different guitar studies icon -- wheat on white background -- (into dropbox for Bob?)
   ☐ get registration PDF for competition to Bob
   ☐ get jury and final jury eval PDFs to Bob. (in the meantime, I will use what I have, which has Nathaniel's name)
