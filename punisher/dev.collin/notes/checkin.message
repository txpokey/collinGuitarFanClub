T: sticky footer == FIXED on news, events faculty
.................................
debug colors still on but... now fixed the news page with the same solution as events + faculty.
next: fix the links page
.................................
fixed a problem where the ul in the footer was padding the sponsor icons and forcing a higher footer size
followed [a couple] examples showing outside container is flex with a height, then tell the content to 'flex: 1'
next steps: need to tweek the size of the main section...
