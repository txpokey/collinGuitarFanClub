new BRANCH == dev.collin/BROKEN/no-sticky-footer/180825-0

F: sticky footer == BROKEN

----------------------------------
when I use bg colors, the middle content section colors leave short verticle bars at the top left and bottom left
and the footer color ends before any of the bottons appear. So I dont understand this and forcing the current code
to reside on this branch, before immediately branching again to fix this problem.
