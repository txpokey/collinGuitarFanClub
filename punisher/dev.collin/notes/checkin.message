accomplishments:

added new set of carousel images, labeled *--1-4.$(eps|jpg)+ *--1-4N.$(eps|jpg)+
clearly the behavior in bootstrap's carousel is different when compare chrome & firefox.
BUT just rendering the images directly with the browsers, they look the same, apples to apples on whether I preservered the aspect
ratio or not. I standardized on 1000 x 200, and all the 1-4N suffixed images are just that because I turned off the aspect ration
preservation bit.
