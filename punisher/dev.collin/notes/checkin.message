accomplishments:

begin work to fix carousel so that it works within a flexbox on both linux macos. I have mockups on Code Pen showing the desired
behavior. I do not know yet if flexbox screws up bootstrap, or I was screwing up bootstrap by something amiss I was doing. 
So I switched to a REPAIRS-UNDERWAY branch to begin the work. I may have to write my own carousel in the process.
