        Raised in the small town of Hillsboro, Texas, Nathaniel Earhart first experienced music hands on at age 5, through classical piano lesson. After six years he quit his formal piano training to pursue the guitar. Nathaniel was self-taught in popular music for the next seven years until he was introduced to classical guitar, by former Hill College instructor, Stacy Arnold. In the summer of 2008, less than a year later, he began his studies with world class performer and teacher, Robert Guthrie. That fall he transferred from the local community college to Southern Methodist University, where he spent the next two and a half years studying both music and guitar intensively in the Meadows School of the Arts.
